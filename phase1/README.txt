This program provides some functionalities for hosting a Technology Conference. This program should run by running the main method in "Launcher". Make sure to exit the program in order to save information to files externally. The program can only store one conference at a time so creating a new conference deletes the old save. The program will then prompt you to enter corresponding information for the Technology Conference.
