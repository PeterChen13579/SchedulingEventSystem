# SchedulingEventSystem 
This is a Java GUI project that I worked on with 7 other teammates. This program functions very similarly like any event scheduling system, 
where rooms get created by organizer account, then organizers can create events to occur in the room. There are also 3 different events,
(One-speaker event, multi-speaker event, no-speaker event). There are 3 different types of accounts, Attendee account, Organizer account and 
Speaker account. This program also features a messaging system(add friend, message one person, message all attendees etc).

Phase 1 is the program without GUI(text console), and phase 2 is with GUI plus additional features.
